By studying this sample project, developers can gain insights into the best practices for building robust and scalable web applications using Backender 2.

## Getting Started

To get started with writing blueprint code for Hotelino Sample in Backender 2, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new folder for your blueprint files named `Hotelino`.

2. Inside the folder, create or modify the blueprint files based on your desired entities. In the Hotelino Sample, the following blueprint files are available:

   - `Hotelino.xml`: Blueprint for the main hotel entity.
   - `Rooms.xml`: Blueprint for defining the rooms in a hotel.
   - `Financial.xml`: Blueprint for managing financial transactions.
   - `Employees.xml`: Blueprint for managing employees.
   - `Blog.xml`: Blueprint for defining blog posts.

   Open these blueprint files using a text editor and define the desired fields, relationships, and validation rules for each entity.

3. Save the blueprint files after making the necessary changes.

4. Run the Backender.Cli and enter the location of your main blueprint file to generate your backend based on blueprints.

5. Now, Hotelino is created and you can modify the generated code as per your requirements.
